This MVP answers the first question of the project ‘Is the MTA subway more crowded in the Christmas or the New Year periods?’.
The figure below shows that the New Year period ‘Yellow Line’ is more crowded than Christmas ‘Pink Line’ in all stations.<br/><br/>

4. Graph each station with its traffic for both New Year and Christmas.
